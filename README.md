Hackday Project gotta cook up some shii
Ok, so this is a game named ChronoShift which I have expanded on the phrase "Oh, I already knew that"
It is a race against your self. The only enemy in this game is yourself and what you have already done.
Its just a normal platforming level and you gotta reach the end mark manuevering around obstacles sounds easy enough right? except you gotta do the same thing while your past self as a shadow will be competing with you. If you touch the shadow or the shadow reaches the final goal before you, you lose. This game has strategy involved to find the quickest path where you dont have to bump into your past self and reach before your own previous time. Well, you already know what have you done before just outmanuever yourself!
